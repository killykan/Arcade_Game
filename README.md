********* DESCRITPION *********

   This project is a an arcade game, based on the well known 2D Frogger game of the 90's. 
   Basically the player must cross the canvas, avoiding all moving objects, untill he reaches the other side, and he wins.

   I wanted this project to be a little more scenarized. All the basics of the frogger game are represented : the player must cross a dangerous river, avoiding rocks that cross the canvas, and reach the other side in 'one piece'. But I wanted to involve the player a little bit more in this game, and I wanted the game to tell a story too. 

   Indeed, the player must face some dangers to save the princess, before she got eaten by a furious monster.

   But, to do so, the player must cross the river...and if he tries to swim, not only the character will be probably hit by a rock, but it will drown as well.That's why, first of all, you need to find something on the shore to help him out!! 

   But that's not the only thing to do ! 

   If you reach the princess before the monster reaches her, you need to bring her back to the shore, to a safier place, where you started the adventure.

   But beware of the monster ! because as soon as you saved the princess, the monster's behavior will change...listen to what the characters says. 

   Once you bring the princess back to the firecamp, she will gratefully thank you to help saved her.

   Remember ! if your player drowns or gets hit by a rock, the game will reset.
              if the princess dies, the game will reset.
              And if the player and the princess die, eaten by the monster or hit, the game will reset! 


********* HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT *********

To run the project, you only need to open the index.html in your web browser.
If you want to rerun the game, just hit the start button provided on the web page.

nb : if an unexpected error occurs, just rerun the game.

********* HOW TO PLAY *********

In this game, you play the little boy hero at the bottom left of the screen. 
Move your character using the arrow keys of you keyboard.
Do not rush immediately the game, even if the princess is closed to get eaten by the monster. Evaluate the situation, the enemies speeds, and read what your character says, this could be helpful at some point.
If you want to rerun the game, just hit the start button, this will refresh the page.

Hope you will enjoy this little journey.

Have fun !!

nb: I didn't implement lives for your character(I could have), but since the game can reset considering several parameters, it would have been a little bit awkward : hearts of the princess plus hearts for you own player. I think this would have complicated the game, and make the story vanish somehow.
    I have been thinking to add a timer too, but then I thought the monster was your timer !
    I could have added a score like panel, but since the game is based on saving on character, it's useless.

 ********* HOW THIS GAME COULD EVOLVE *********

 Since this game is based on a story, the best way I could make this game evolve, is by adding other levels.

 Once the player would have saved the princess and brought her back to the camp, you could have the choice to stop the adventure or continue your journey.

 If you decide to continue, the player reaches the level 2, with a new map, new dangers, new people to save,...
